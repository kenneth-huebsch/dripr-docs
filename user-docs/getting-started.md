# Getting Started

Use this page as your quick start checklist.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Account

- Add your signature (name, phone, and logo/photo if you want).
- Connect Gmail if you want emails to come from your own address.
- Check your plan so you know how many active leads you can run.

## Step 2: Pick the Right Campaign Type

### Home Valuation Campaign
Best for past clients/homeowners when you know their address.

You need:
- First name
- Last name
- Email
- Property address

### Market Update Campaign (No Address)
Best for new prospects when you do not know their address.

You need:
- First name
- Last name
- Email
- ZIP code

## Step 3: Create Your First Lead

- Open your Leads page.
- Click `+ New Lead`.
- Choose Home Valuation or Market Update.
- Pick your monthly send day (1-28).
- Save the campaign.

## Step 4: Know When the First Email Sends

The first email may not send right away. It depends on:

- Your approval settings
- First-send delay rules
- Working-hours sending rules

You can always check progress in Lead Details and Email History.

## Step 5: Check Results on Dashboard

Watch these numbers:
- Active leads
- Emails sent
- Opens
- Unsubscribes
- Spam complaints

## Easy Best Practices

- Start with 5-10 leads first.
- Keep your list clean (correct email + correct address/ZIP).
- Check unapproved emails often.
- After testing, use CSV upload to save time.
