# Create and Manage Campaigns

Each lead you add becomes a recurring monthly email campaign.

## Campaign Types

### Home Valuation Campaign
Use this for homeowners when you have a property address.

Usually includes:
- Their home value section
- Local market trends
- Nearby listings and recent sales

### Market Update Campaign (No Address)
Use this when you do not have an address, but do have a ZIP code.

This version skips the home-value section and focuses on local market content.

## Required Contact Fields

For every lead:
- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`

Then add one:
- `formatted_address` (home valuation)
- `zip_code` (no-address market update)

## Monthly Send Day

Choose the day each monthly email should go out.

- Select a day from `1-28`.
- This keeps sends consistent month to month.
- The first email can follow separate first-send timing rules.

## Editing Campaigns

You can edit lead details later, including monthly send day.

Good to know:
- Changing send day updates future sends.
- Edits should not trigger instant sends.
- Disabled campaigns stay paused until re-enabled.
