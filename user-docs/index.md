## What Dripr Helps You Do

Dripr sends monthly real estate update emails for your contacts so you stay top-of-mind.

- **Home Valuation Campaign**: Use when you have the contact's property address.
- **Market Update Campaign**: Use when you do not have an address, but you do have ZIP code.

If you are brand new, start with the Getting Started guide and create 1-2 test leads first.
