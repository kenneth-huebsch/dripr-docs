# Troubleshooting

Quick fixes for the most common issues.

## Campaign Won't Create

Check these first:
- Required fields are present.
- Email looks correct.
- You are within your plan limit.
- Address or ZIP matches the campaign type.

## Campaign Stuck or Slow

Try this:
1. Refresh the lead details page.
2. Check current campaign and email status.
3. Wait a little and refresh again.

If nothing changes after a while, contact support and include campaign ID.

## Email Not Sending

Common causes:
- Waiting for manual approval
- First-email delay still active
- Sending window not open yet
- Campaign disabled
- Lead unsubscribed/bounced/spam complaint

## Older Draft Marked Expired

This is normal if a newer cycle replaced an older unapproved draft.  
Expired drafts stay in history but cannot be sent.

## Bulk Upload Errors

Review:
- CSV headers and formatting
- Duplicate emails
- Undeliverable addresses
- Address lookup failures

Fix the source file and re-upload.

## Metrics Look Off

- Dashboard uses rolling 30-day and lifetime counters.
- Delivery and engagement events can arrive after initial send.
- Refresh to fetch latest aggregates.

## When to Contact Support

Share:
- Your account email
- Campaign ID(s)
- Approximate time issue started
- Screenshot of the error/status

This helps support fix things faster.
