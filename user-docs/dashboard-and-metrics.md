# Dashboard and Metrics

Your Dashboard shows how your email marketing is doing.

## Leads

- **Total Leads**: How many active leads you currently have.
- **New Leads (30d)**: How many leads were added in the last 30 days.

## This Month's Email Performance

These numbers are based on the last 30 days:
- Emails sent
- Emails opened
- Unsubscribes
- Spam complaints

## Lifetime Email Performance

These are all-time totals:
- Total sent
- Total opened
- Total unsubscribes
- Total spam complaints

## Quick Tips

- Low opens -> test better subject lines.
- High unsubscribes -> send less often or improve who you send to.
- Any spam complaints -> clean your list and review your email tone/content.

## Good to Know

- "30 days" is a rolling window (not a calendar month).
- Numbers may update after delivery/open events come in.
