# Billing and Plans

Your plan controls how many active leads you can have.

## Plan Limits

- Your plan sets a maximum number of **active** campaigns.
- Disabled campaigns do not count toward the active limit.
- If you hit your limit, you cannot add/enable more leads until you free space or upgrade.

## Choosing or Changing Plans

- Choose a plan that fits your lead volume.
- Upgrading gives you room for more active leads.
- Downgrading may be blocked if you are above the lower plan limit.

## Cancellation Behavior

When a subscription is canceled or becomes inactive:
- Campaigns can pause/disable.
- Your data stays in your account.
- Sending stops until you reactivate billing.

## Bulk Upload and Limits

Bulk upload still follows your plan limits.  
If upload would exceed your limit, it can be rejected.

## Need More Than Standard Plans?

Dripr also supports custom plans with custom limits. These may be provisioned differently from standard plans.

## If Your Plan Seems Wrong

If plan behavior looks incorrect:
- Refresh your account and dashboard pages.
- Confirm current active campaign count.
- Check your subscription status in your account page.
- Contact support with your account email and expected plan limit.
