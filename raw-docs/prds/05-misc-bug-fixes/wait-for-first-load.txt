There is a bug in the UI that I would like you to fix.

Whenever a user creates a new account, they are directed to the UI, which then trys to fetch data and fails because there is no data in the system for that user yet. The reason for this is because a User isnt created in the system until it gets a webhook called from clerk. So there is a race condition that needs handled at the time of account creation.
