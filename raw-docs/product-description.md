# Problem we are trying to solve
"91% of realtors don’t contact the buyer or seller of a home after closing." –National Association of Realtors
as a result of the previous stat.
"Only 28% of sellers used an agent whom they’d previously worked with." –National Association of Realtors
Most real estate agents understand the importance of staying in touch, but face three critical obstacles:
1. Time constraints: Manually creating personalized market updates for dozens or hundreds of clients is impossible
1. Clunky tools: Most of the marketing tools out there that provide personalization are difficult to get started with and are expensive
1. Lack of value: Generic "Just checking in!" emails get ignored or marked as spam
As a result of these barriers, agents lose touch with past clients. They forget about you. When they're ready to buy or sell again, they work with whoever reached out most recently—and that's probably not them.

# SaaS Description
Dripr (pronounced "Dripper") is application where real estate agents can create drip email campaings for the purpose of nurturing reltionships with past clients or creating relationships with potential new clients, so that when these clients decide to buy or sell, Dripr users are top of mind.

# Our differentiator
There is another product that dominates the market called RealScout. RealScout is feature rich, but as a result expensive, and difficult to onboard. Dripr's value lies with agents would would prefer speed, ease of use, and cost effectivness over fine grained control.
Highly Personalized - Dripr AI crafts truly unique content for each client with specifics about their property and community, making every email feel personal and relevant. Finally you can ditch the generic newsletters.
Quick and Easy Setup - Launch your first real estate drip campaign in minutes. Simply enter a client's name, email, and physical address and hit go. For bulk uploads, put that same info into a CSV file and upload your whole CRM. No complex integrations or technical headaches.
Cheaper - since we are small, we can operate with very low overhead and price ourselves better then the competition.

# Target Audience
Real estate agents who would like to get started with email marketing, but prefer not to invest too much time and money into the process. Real estate agents who are not super tech savy or experienced in marketing is our taret market.

# How it works.
When an agent wants to create a new campaign they enter the client's name, email, and property address. Or they can upload a CSV of their whole client list with those fields. The system will look up their property on API sources to get its current value. The system will determine the recipients local population density and use that to determine an intelligent radius to search for active listings and recent sales. The system will reach out to sources like Fannie Mae and various market data providers to determine national market stats such as interest rate and local market stats such as local average time on the market, average price per square foot, etc... and then compare these stats to the same stats from several months ago. 

The system intelligently varies email content to keep recipients engaged: alternating months feature local business highlights from the client's neighborhood (restaurants, shops, services), while other months showcase expert real estate tips. This ensures each email feels fresh and provides genuine value beyond just property data.

At the end of collecting personalized information, the system puts together an email that it will send out monthly. The clients get different intros, analysis, and community content each month so each email continues to feel fresh and relevant.
